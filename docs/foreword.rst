AViS (pronounced ayy-vis or エイヴィス) is an analysis and visualization application for Molecular Dynamics Simulations.
It is written by me (Pua Kai). The program is written under the C++11 and OpenGL3.3 standard.

AViS is based on a fork of ChokoLait C++ game engine library, also written by me.

AViS (and ChokoLait) uses the following open-source libraries, in no particular order.

* GLEW
* GLFW
* GLM
* LodePNG
* JPEGlib
* HDRlib
* libGIF
* libGWAVI
* Freetype
* LibSSH2
* RadeonRays
